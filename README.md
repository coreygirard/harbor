*docs made simple*

**Harbor** 
1. *(noun)* A place of shelter 
2. *(noun)* An area for ships to dock 
3. *(noun)* An elegant documentation generator 
 
### What
 
**Harbor** aims to be a minimalist generator of fine Markdown documentation. 
 
### Why
 
There are plenty of powerful documentation generators out there, but I wanted
something nice and simple for small projects, that reads straight from the
source code, makes as few assumptions as possible, and outputs plain Markdown
files. 
 
 
It's designed to be simple enough to be used manually to generate a doc skeleton
for manual tweaking, but also modular enough to be used in an automated build
pipeline. 
 
 
### Philosophy 
- **Have no opinions:** *Don't enforce any particular style. Just allow the
definition of arbitrary macros for text modification. With the correct `.harbor`
file, this could conceivably generate HTML.* 
 
- **Favor flexibility over power:** *The small convenience gained by
auto-detecting which class or function definitions a given docs section is near
is far outweighed by the loss of potential layout options or non-standard
formatting choices* 
 
- **Favor clarity over speed:** *The purpose here is mainly to provide ease of
use. Simple rules, easily remembered, beat clever tricks that squeeze a few
microseconds out of compile time. At least in this use case. Harbor is for when
you value your own time above the computer's.* 
 
 
### How
 
 
Generating documentation with **Harbor** requires a single file, plus tagged
comments in your existing source code. The file is a `.harbor` file, which
specifies both the structure of the output file and any text macros to be
applied to the output. An example: 
 
 
``` 
OUTLINE 
readme: README.md 
  badges 
  what 
  why 
  how 
    intro 
    outline 
    patterns 
 
  todo 
 
PATTERNS 
title: 
    # {title} 
section: 
    ### {section} 
```
 
 
The outline section of the `.harbor` file must be preceded by `OUTLINE`. This
section specifies the names of the files to be generated, and their internal
structure 
 
 
 
Each line in the `OUTLINE` section without indentation denotes a file. The form
is `aaa: bbb`, where `aaa` is the nickname for the file, and `bbb` is the actual
filename to use when saving the generated documentation. 
 
 
Basic outline indentation rules apply, with regard to how nesting works. The
sections can have arbitrary names, excluding spaces. Best practice for
multi-word sections is Lisp-style naming: `another-section` or
`this-is-a-wordy-label`. 
 
 
Once the outline is specified, comments can be written into the source code. 
An example comment: 
 
```

### TODO
 
 
- [ ] Allow multiple inputs to text replacement macros 
- [ ] Clean output to be even more human- readable/editable 
- [ ] Handle multi-line inputs to macros 
- [ ] REFACTOR 
- [ ] Implement a 'trace' function to print an outline of the docs' origins (file name and line number) 
- [ ] Experiment with supporting project languages other than Python
