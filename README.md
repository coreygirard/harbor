harbor: readme/what

**Harbor**
1. *(noun)* A place of shelter
2. *(noun)* An area for ships to dock
3. *(noun)* An elegant documentation generator

### What

**Harbor** aims to be a minimalist generator of fine Markdown documentation.
There are plenty of powerful documentation generators out there, but I wanted
something nice and simple for small projects, that reads straight from the source
code, makes as few assumptions as possible, and outputs plain Markdown files.harbor: readme/why

### Why

**Harbor** aims to be a minimalist generator of fine Markdown documentation.
There are plenty of powerful documentation generators out there, but I wanted
something nice and simple for small projects, that reads straight from the source
code, makes as few assumptions as possible, and outputs plain Markdown files.

It's designed to be simple enough to be used manually to generate a doc skeleton
for manual tweaking, but also modular enough to be used in an automated build pipeline.

### Philosophy
- **Have no opinions:** *Don't enforce any particular style. Just allow the definition of
arbitrary macros for text modification. With the correct `.harbor` file, this
could conceivably generate HTML.*
- **Favor flexibility over power:** *The small convenience gained by auto-detecting
which class or function definitions a given docs section is near is far outweighed by the loss
of potential layout options or non-standard formatting choices*
- **Favor clarity over speed:** *The purpose here is mainly to provide ease of use. Simple rules,
easily remembered, beat clever tricks that squeeze a few microseconds out of compile time. At least
in this use case. Harbor is for when you value your own time above computation time.*harbor: readme/how/outline

Each line in the `OUTLINE` section without indentation denotes a file. The form is `aaa: bbb`,
where `aaa` is the nickname for the file, and `bbb` is the actual filename to use when saving
the generated documentation.

Basic outline indentation rules apply, with regard to how nesting works. The sections can have
arbitrary names, excluding spaces. Best practice for multi-word sections is Lisp-style naming:
`another-section` or `this-is-a-wordy-label`.harbor: readme/todo

[ ] Allow multiple inputs to text replacement macros
[ ] Clean output to be even more human- readable/editable
[ ] Handle multi-line inputs to macros
